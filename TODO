# Things to add

- Configure positioning of FF chain button (fixed floating, relative to other elements, etc)
- Define range of FF button targets (max FF number or "Easy"/"Medium")
- Add better error messages for when you have a bad key (specifically that the key provided to ff scouter script isn't valid or is not registered)
